# sentiment-analysis-using-PySpark
This project handles social media analytics using spark to analyze social media data. The aim of the project is to predict the sentiment analysis for any tweet & post on social media.
We used a trusted dataset from Kaggle, and it is labeled data, it is about ~162,980 tweets before the cleaning process.
In order to use PySpark as an interface for Apache Spark, we began by looking at the spark tools, platforms, and machine learning algorithms that are available on the MLIB.
After a preliminary study of the available algorithms and reviewing our dataset, we found that the problem is classification, and we can use supervised learning in this project.
After much data cleaning, preprocessing, and trying multiple algorithms, we achieved an accuracy 85% because we tried more than one algorithm like logistic regression, na√Øve bayes, and random forest and finally we used the highest accuracy (logistic regression).
The process of achieving this accuracy was not easy but after much work we did it.
